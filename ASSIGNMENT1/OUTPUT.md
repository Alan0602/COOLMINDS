## 2.NaturalLanguageMultiply
#### Question: 2.
  Write a program that will multiply two numbers in the range of zero to ninety-nine. java NaturalLanguageMultiply thirty-two ten and see 320 
 - Notes: 
 - It is okay to have global constants in a program. You can initialize global constants with a static block if you need to. 
 - If you create a method or class attribute that is for internal use only be sure to declare it private. 
 - Use one HashMap object that contains no more than 28 objects. 
 - Include a method with this signature: "private static int toInt( String s ) throws Exception". The exception is if the string is not recognized and contains the message you want to show to your user. 
 - The program must specify what text is not recognized. 
 - Purpose: To learn how to work with a HashMap, how to use static blocks to initialize, how to throw and catch exceptions
